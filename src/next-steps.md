# Next Steps

As stated in the [introduction], this guide is not meant to be a replacement for proper learning of the Rust language. Rust has great documentation and books that you can explore to continue with your journey of mastering the language.

Here are a few recommendations for your next steps:

- Check out the [Learn Rust][learn-rust] page of the official Rust website for excellent resources.
- [Rust for Rustaceans][rust-for-rustaceans], a book by Jon Gjengset is ideal after 
  becoming comfortable with the basics of the language.
- [Programming Rust][programming-rust], a book by Jim Blandy, et al.
- [Effective Rust][effective-rust] by David Drysdale.
