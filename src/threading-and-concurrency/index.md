# Threading and Concurrency

The Rust standard library supports threading, synchronization and concurrency. Even though the language itself and the standard library do have basic support for these concepts, a lot of additional functionality is provided by crates and will not be covered in this section.

This section focuses on the following concepts related to threading and concurrency:

- [Threads](threads.md)
- [Synchronization](synchronization.md)
- [Producer-Consumer Pattern](producer-consumer.md)
