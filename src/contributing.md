# Contributing

You are invited to contribute to this guide by opening issues and
submitting pull requests!

Here are some ideas üí° for how and where you can help most with
contributions:

- Fix any spelling or grammatical mistakes you see as you read.

- Fix technical inaccuracies.

- Fix logical or compilation errors in code examples.

- Expand an explanation to provide more context or improve the clarity of some
  topic or concept.

- Keep it fresh with changes in Java and Rust. For example, if there is a
  change in Java or Rust that brings the two languages closer together, then some
  parts, including sample code, may need revision.

If you're making a small to modest correction, such as fixing a spelling mistake or
a syntax error in a code example, then feel free to submit a pull request
directly. For changes that may require a large effort on your part (and reviewers as a result), it is strongly recommended that you submit an issue and seek approval of the author/maintainer before investing your time.

Making quick contributions has been made super simple. If you see an error on
a page and happen to be online, you can click the edit icon üìù in the top right corner of
the page to edit the Markdown source of the content and submit a change.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Stick to the goals of this guide laid out in the [introduction]; put another
  way, avoid the non-goals!

- Prefer to keep text short and use short, concise and realistic code examples
  to illustrate a point.

- As much as it is possible, always provide and compare examples in Rust and
  Java.

- Feel free to use latest Java/Rust language features if it makes an example
  simpler, concise and alike across the two languages.

- Make example code as self-contained as possible and runnable (unless the
  idea is to illustrate a compile-time or run-time error).
